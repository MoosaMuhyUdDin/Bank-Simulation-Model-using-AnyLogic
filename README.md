The Bank Simulation Model is an interactive AnyLogic model that simulates the customer flow and waiting times in a bank with an information section, six counters, and three ATMs, each with its own waiting area. The model includes walls and charts such as bar graphs for queue visualization and histograms for time measurement.

One of the unique features of this model is its 3D view, which allows users to explore the model from any angle, providing a more immersive and realistic experience. The model can be used to optimize staffing and scheduling, improve customer satisfaction, and reduce waiting times at the bank.

The information section of the bank provides customers with information about their problem or inquiry, and guides them to the appropriate counter or ATM. Each counter and ATM has its own waiting area, where customers can wait for their turn to be served. The model includes a queuing system that ensures customers are served in a first-come, first-served basis, with priority given to customers with urgent needs.
The charts in the model provide real-time data on customer waiting times, queue lengths, and service times, enabling bankers to identify areas for improvement and make data-driven decisions. The model can be adjusted to test different scenarios, such as changing staffing levels, adjusting counter or ATM capacities, or implementing different service protocols.

This model is an ideal tool for both academic and industry professionals interested in studying banking operations and customer service. It provides an efficient and interactive way to study customer flow and waiting times, and offers valuable insights into how banks can optimize their operations and improve customer satisfaction. With its 3D view and real-time data analysis, this model is a powerful tool for improving banking operations and customer service.
